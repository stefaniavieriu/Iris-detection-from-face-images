# Iris-detection-from-face-images

* During the last year of college, I met my teacher in Statistical Signal Processing course. He recommended me Biometrics topic. Since then, I have started exploring about Biometrics, such as Fingerprint, Iris, and Face.

* I searched on Internet and found out an open-source Iris Recognition model, which was written on Matlab. Thanks to the author of this open-source code, I could make my own system.Based on the available functions, I have modified, connected, and designed my individual system on Matlab.

* My contribution is creating a friendly GUI so that user can use it as a convenient software. Moreover, in my modified system, I utilized hardware to boost runtime performance in order to make it faster than the original version.

* Starting with these first words, this theme is the result of a curiosity to help improve the fatigue detection system through image processing. The paper "Iris detection from face images" ( final year project) addresses the theoretical and practical part of an image processing application in the MATLAB program, which offers image retrieval, analysis and manipulation functions through access to images stored in the computer.
